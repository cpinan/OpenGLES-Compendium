# OpenGLES Compendium

I couldn't find examples in Kotlin with OpenGLES (maybe you're not going to use it, but I enjoy doing this)

First of all, I wrote the codes from the computer graphics course in the 
Imperial College of London.

Here are the links:

+ [Intro to Android Graphics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-android-graphics)

+ [Android Graphics OpenGLES](https://www.coursera.org/learn/android-graphics-opengl-es)

+ [3D Graphics and Sensor](https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-graphics-android-sensors-vr)

You can check the code here:

If you want to check a canvas 3D example, take a look at this:

[![Canvas 3D](http://img.youtube.com/vi/iXw2VfPvmJ8/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/iXw2VfPvmJ8)

It's still in progress, but it contains great examples of:

+ Light
+ Textures
+ Object generation
+ Canvas
+ Matrix
+ More

Also, I created some examples (it's still ongoing), for loading obj files and show them, here is a video with a preview:

[The code is here](https://github.com/cpinan/OpenGLES-Compendium/blob/master/OpenGLESExamples/app/src/main/java/com/carlospinan/openglesexamples/examples/OBJActivity.kt)

Going to still uploading examples, some games, and after that a few examples of Vulkan.

Enjoy!
